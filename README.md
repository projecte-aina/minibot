# About

Minibot is a demonstration of how conversational experiences can be created in Catalan using open-source language technologies.

It is built with open-source speech recognition (STT), speech synthesis (TTS), and natural language understanding (NLU) technologies. This repository includes the central NLU language understanding server with RASA, its connectors to the STT microservice based on [Vosk](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-server), and the Catalan TTS-API based on [üê∏ Coqui TTS](https://github.com/projecte-aina/tts-api).

### Architecture Overview

The complete architecture is illustrated below
